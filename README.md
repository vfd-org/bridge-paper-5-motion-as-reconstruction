# Bridge Paper 5: Motion as Reconstruction

This repository contains **Bridge Paper 5 (BP5)** of the *Vibrational Field Dynamics* (VFD) programme.

BP5 provides a precise and conservative clarification of how **motion** should be interpreted in stabilised geometric field theories. Rather than treating motion as primitive transport of an object through a background, the paper shows that apparent motion arises from **reconstruction-consistent persistence of stabilised configurations across reference frames**.

The results preserve all effective dynamics derived in Bridge Paper 4 (BP4), including inertial mass and Newtonian limits, while resolving a longstanding conceptual ambiguity regarding what, if anything, is “moving”.

## 🔍 Scope and Intent

This paper:

- Reinterprets collective coordinates as **labels of reconstruction-consistent representatives**
- Preserves BP4’s effective dynamics exactly
- Treats relativity as a **consistency constraint**, not a derived symmetry
- Introduces no new forces, particles, or ontologies
- Makes no claims regarding quantum mechanics, consciousness, or quantum gravity

This is a **clarification and unification paper**, not a speculative extension.

## 🔗 Relation to Other Bridge Papers

- **BP3 / BP3.5:** Stabilised geometry and persistence  
- **BP4:** Effective dynamics and emergent inertia  
- **BP5 (this paper):** Interpretation of motion as reconstruction  

BP5 closes the conceptual loop required to prevent BP4 from being misread as assuming primitive transport or background motion.
